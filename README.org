tides.el is intended to provide elisp mechanisms for accessing [[https://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/][NOAA
tidal forecast data]].

* Status

It is currently in a alpha state and ready for tinkering. Expect bugs
and rough edges.

* Usage

Predictions can be viewed interactively via ~tides-predict~, which
will present today's tidal forecast in roughly columnar format.

~tides-predict~ can also be called from elisp with a callback, for
example:

#+begin_src elisp
  (tides-predict (lambda (predictions)
                   (message "I have received %d predictions."
                            (length predictions))))
#+end_src

Please see the docstring of ~tides-predict~ for details on the format
of the predictions.
